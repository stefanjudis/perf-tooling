  "description" : "Smush.it uses optimization techniques specific to image format to remove unnecessary bytes from image files. It is a \"lossless\" tool, which means it optimizes the images without changing their look or visual quality. After Smush.it runs on a web page it reports how many bytes would be saved by optimizing the page's images and provides a downloadable zip file with the minimized image files.",
