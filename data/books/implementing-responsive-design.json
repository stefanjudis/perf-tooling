  "description" : "New devices and platforms emerge daily. Browsers iterate at a remarkable pace. Faced with this volatile landscape we can either struggle for control or we can embrace the inherent flexibility of the web. Responsive design is not just another technique--it is the beginning of the maturation of a medium and a fundamental shift in the way we think about the web.
